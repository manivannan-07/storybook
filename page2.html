   <h1>The Beginning of story</h1>
   </div>
   <p>Adventure stories are different from moral stories in many ways. Moral stories revolve around daily life characters like animals, trees, and human beings. An adventure story, on the other hand, involves many fantasy characters including demons, sorcerers, genie, devils, and other creatures that we don’t meet in daily life.</p>

 <h3>Story of a Boy and a Magic Stone</h3>
 </div>
 
  <p>Once upon a time, there lived a young boy with his mother. His father passed away while he was an infant. His mother struggles hard to make the ends meet. 

They are poor and are waiting for good days to come. All that she wanted was to feed her son 3 times a day and give him a good education. But with the little money they have, it seems a distant dream for her all the time. She never lost her hope and kept her faith in God praying for good days to arrive.

One night, the boy had a vivid dream in his sleep. 

The boy saw a saint who gave his clear instructions on how he can become rich. According to him, there is a magic stone that can convert sand to gold in a secret place. But to attain that stone, the boy has to cross forests and dangerous lakes with care and all alone. 

The whole journey will last for 21 days and if the boy completed the journey successfully according to the Saint’s instructions, he can get the magic stone.

In the dream, the saint also gifted a magic robe and a ring. If the boy wears the magic robe, no one or nothing can see him. In the same way, if the boy rubs the ring thrice and says, “Hubuja!!” he will get food and water. He also warned that the stone should be used judiciously and not with greed.

The boy woke up suddenly at midnight because of this dream. He could not understand if this was real or only a dream. To his surprise, he found the magic robe on his bedside and a golden colored shiny ring on his right-hand ring finger!

The boy immediately woke up his mother and told all that the saint shared with him in the dream. He also said about the journey alone. He showed the magic robe and ring. The mother was first confused. She thought it must be a normal dream. But after she saw the robe and the ring, she had to believe that this is something powerful. But she was very afraid to send her son all alone! He is a young lad and how can any mother send her son to forests and dangerous lakes?

While she was confused with these thoughts, the boy assured his mother. He said that there should have been a reason why the dream occurred to him. Also, he said that their poverty will end forever if he gained that magic stone. Saying so, he convinced his mother.

The next day, early morning, the boy took his mother’s blessings and set out on the journey. He traveled many miles east and reached a forest as per the Saint’s instructions. <p>
