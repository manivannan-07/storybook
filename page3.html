	<p>By that time it was getting dark and the boy started feeling hungry and giddy at the same time. He sat in a place and rubbed the ring thrice. At the very mention of “Hubuja!!”, viola. There are many favorite food items for him. He ate all of them happily. Then he started feeling afraid as it was getting dark and he is alone in the middle of a forest. Then he remembered the robe.

The boy cleared an area and made it convenient to sleep. He slept by wearing the robe. Now, no thieves or animals or anyone can see him! There he goes!

The next morning, the boy woke up at sunrise. Again he started his journey. The forests never seemed to end with many dangerous animals also passing by. The boy remembered to wear the robe all the time whenever he sensed any dangerous animals to be appearing nearby.

Thus, he traveled for ten days and then finally reached a lake. He had his dinner at night and slept at the lakeside like always in his robe.

The next morning, it was his time to swim across the lake. Poor boy, he does not swim! What should he do now? He sat thinking about how to go across the lake. Then there appeared many crocodiles in the lake. The boy got a plan. He wore the robe and jumped onto the back of the crocodile. He sat on it, but the crocodile never knew this. As he reached another crocodile, then he jumped onto its back. Like this, he used crocodiles as his steps to cross the lake. </p>
