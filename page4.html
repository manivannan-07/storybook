    <p>Finally, he crossed the lake and reached another forest.

As he moved on, he reached a dead-end where there was nothing but a deep cave. He could see nothing and was so scared to enter it. </p>

     <p>He sat in front of the cave and wanted to have a meal. He rubbed the ring thrice and said “Hubuja!!” He had a sumptuous meal and drank the delicious honey that also comes along with the meal this time.

The boy somehow gathered some courage and set a step into the cave. To his surprise, there was a torch kind of light from his own eyes. This light helped him see the path. He understood that it could be due to the power of the honey. He never got honey till now from the ring but got it only today. He thanked the Saint wholeheartedly and started moving forward.

Like this, he kept walking, walking, and walking. Deep inside the cave, he knew no morning no night. It was dark and all that saw was a path filled with dried leaves. When he was tired, he sat and slept using the robe. The journey lasted for many days. The boy finally reached a big trunk. The trunk was dazzling and he opened it without any delay. </p>

  <p>Good, God! He saw a dazzling shiny stone. He took it into his hands and kissed it with happiness. Viola, there he goes! He is in his home with his mother!!

Both the son and mother knew no bounds for their joy. The mother was so happy that her son returned home safely and successfully. 

They thanked the saint immensely and to God for giving them their most awaited happy times. From then, they started turning sand into gold as and when they needed,  taking care of Saint’s instructions and lived happily without any poverty.</p>
