	   <p>The moral of the story is that the pursuit of materialistic desires and power can often lead us away from the things that truly matter in life. It's essential to appreciate the simple joys, cherish meaningful relationships, and find happiness within ourselves. Sometimes, the most magical thing in life is not a wish-granting stone but the wisdom to be content with what we have and to embrace the beauty of everyday life.</p>
